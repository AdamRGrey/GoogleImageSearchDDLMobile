# GoogleImageSearchDDLMobile
Google doesn't want to let you download images directly. But you can just take a screenshot, so... why not just maintain the image quality?

# Installation
this is a greasemonkey script. 
1. [Get greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
2. [install](https://github.com/AdamRGrey/GoogleImageSearchDDLMobile/raw/master/GoogleImageSearchDDLMobile.user.js).

# Usage
1. run a google search for images. 
2. Click one to be brought to its details
3. refresh the page (just noticed this, going to fix)
4. you know below the image, on the left, it shows a globe icon and normally the name of the domain where the image is? It now says "direct". Click that.
5. You'll be brought to the image, directly. Rather than the page that hosts the image. Download as usual.
